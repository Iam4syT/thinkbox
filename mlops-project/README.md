# 🧠⚙️🚀 MLOps Project

The **MLOps Project** is a Python-based solution for automating and streamlining the machine learning lifecycle.  
It addresses challenges such as **model versioning**, **data drift detection**, and **CI/CD for ML workflows**, helping teams deploy, monitor, and enhance ML models reliably.

---

# 💡 Backstory

Inspired by the complexity and manual effort involved in deploying machine learning models to production, this project was born out of the need for a more robust, automated pipeline.  
After being reached out for an MLOps role, considering my training in DevOps and AI Engineering.I set out to take a fundamentals tutorial, fork the repository, and practice the concept.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Automated Data Ingestion & Validation**: Effortlessly bring in and check datasets for quality.
- 📈 **Scalable Model Training & Experiment Tracking**: Run reproducible ML experiments and track metrics.
- 📦 **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) for ML Models**: Automate model builds, tests, and deployments.
- 🧪 **Model Versioning & Registry**: Manage multiple model versions and store metadata.
- ⚙️ **Automated Model Deployment**: Push models to production environments with minimal effort.
- 🚨 **Model Monitoring & Alerting**: Detect performance degradation and data drift in real time.
- 🔍 **Explainability Integrations**: Integrate XAI tools for model transparency.
- 🌐 **Cloud-Agnostic Deployments**: Supports AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premise setups.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iam4syT/thinkbox.git
   cd mlops-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Typical pipeline commands:

- **Run data ingestion:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/data_ingestion.py
  ```

- **Train a model and log experiments:**
  ```bash
  mlflow run . -e train_model
  ```

- **Deploy the model via Docker:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t my_ml_model .
  docker run -p 8000:8000 my_ml_model
  ```

- **Access the prediction API:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [1, 2, 3]}'
  ```

## 📊 Example

A simple training pipeline run example:
```python
from zenml.config import DockerSettings
from zenml.integrations.constants import MLFLOW
from zenml.pipelines import pipeline

docker_settings = DockerSettings(required_integrations=[MLFLOW])


@pipeline(enable_cache=False, settings={"docker": docker_settings})
def train_pipeline(ingest_data, clean_data, model_train, evaluation):
    """
    Args:
        ingest_data: DataClass
        clean_data: DataClass
        model_train: DataClass
        evaluation: DataClass
    Returns:
        mse: float
        rmse: float
    """
    df = ingest_data()
    x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = clean_data(df)
    model = model_train(x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test)
    mse, rmse = evaluation(model, x_test, y_test)

```

## 👨‍💻 Author

Developed by Ayush Singh,the Data Scientist at Replayed, Founder - SecondBrainLabs, and your guide on this journey. I've led several products in the creators' economy and worked as an MLOps engineer on one of the fastest-growing MLOps frameworks, ZenML. With experience as a Data Scientist at Artifact and building large-scale NLP products even before GPT was launched, I bring to the table a wealth of knowledge and practical insights that will enrich your learning experience.
