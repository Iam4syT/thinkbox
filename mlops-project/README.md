‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
[EXPLAIN HOW USERS CAN INTERACT WITH YOUR MLOPS PROJECT. PROVIDE COMMANDS TO RUN PIPELINES, TRAIN MODELS, DEPLOY SERVICES, ETC.]
Example for a typical MLOps project:

Run the data ingestion pipeline:

python scripts/data_ingestion.py

Train a model and log experiments:

mlflow run . -e train_model

Deploy the model (e.g., to a local Docker container):

docker build -t YOUR_MODEL_IMAGE_NAME .
docker run -p 8000:8000 YOUR_MODEL_IMAGE_NAME

Access the prediction API:

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [1, 2, 3]}'

üìä Example (Optional)
[PROVIDE A SMALL ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE. THIS COULD BE A CODE SNIPPET SHOWING INPUT/OUTPUT, A SCREENSHOT OF A DASHBOARD, OR A SIMPLE WORKFLOW DESCRIPTION.]
Example for a model training run:

# Example of training a simple model
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import mlflow

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("data/processed/clean_data.csv")
X = data.drop("target", axis=1)
y = data["target"]

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

with mlflow.start_run():
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "logistic_regression_model")
    print("Model trained and logged to MLflow.")

üîÆ Roadmap
Our future plans and ongoing development include:

[ ] Integrate more advanced data versioning (e.g., with DVC for large datasets).

[ ] Implement drift detection for both data and model predictions.

[ ] Enhance model explainability dashboards.

[ ] Expand cloud deployment options (e.g., multi-cloud support).

[ ] Develop a user-friendly web interface for MLOps dashboard.

[ ] Add comprehensive end-to-end tests for the entire pipeline.

[ ] Explore serverless deployment patterns.
