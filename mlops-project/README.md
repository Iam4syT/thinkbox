# 🧠⚙️🚀 MLOps Project

The **MLOps Project** is a Python-based solution for automating and streamlining the machine learning lifecycle.  
It addresses challenges such as **model versioning**, **data drift detection**, and **CI/CD for ML workflows**, helping teams deploy, monitor, and enhance ML models reliably.

---

# 💡 Backstory

Inspired by the complexity and manual effort involved in deploying machine learning models to production, this project was born out of the need for a more robust, automated pipeline.  
After being reached out for an MLOps role, considering my training in DevOps and AI Engineering.I set out to take a fundamentals tutorial, fork the repository, and practice the concept.

- 📦 **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) for ML Models**: Automate model builds, tests, and deployments.
- 🧪 **Model Versioning & Registry**: Manage multiple model versions and store metadata.
- ⚙️ **Automated Model Deployment**: Push models to production environments with minimal effort.
- 🚨 **Model Monitoring & Alerting**: Detect performance degradation and data drift in real time.
- 🔍 **Explainability Integrations**: Integrate XAI tools for model transparency.
- 🌐 **Cloud-Agnostic Deployments**: Supports AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premise setups.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iam4syT/thinkbox.git
   cd mlops-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Typical pipeline commands:

- **Run data ingestion:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/data_ingestion.py
  ```

- **Train a model and log experiments:**
  ```bash
  mlflow run . -e train_model
  ```

- **Deploy the model via Docker:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t my_ml_model .
  docker run -p 8000:8000 my_ml_model
  ```

- **Access the prediction API:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [1, 2, 3]}'
  ```

## 📊 Example

A simple training run example:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import mlflow

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("data/processed/clean_data.csv")
X = data.drop("target", axis=1)
y = data["target"]

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

with mlflow.start_run():
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "logistic_regression_model")
    print("Model trained and logged to MLflow.")
```

## 👨‍💻 Author

Developed by Ayush Singh,the Data Scientist at Replayed, Founder - SecondBrainLabs, and your guide on this journey. I've led several products in the creators' economy and worked as an MLOps engineer on one of the fastest-growing MLOps frameworks, ZenML. With experience as a Data Scientist at Artifact and building large-scale NLP products even before GPT was launched, I bring to the table a wealth of knowledge and practical insights that will enrich your learning experience.
