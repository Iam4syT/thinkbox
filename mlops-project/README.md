# ⚙️ MLOps Project

The **MLOps Project** is a Python-based framework for automating and streamlining the machine learning lifecycle.  
It solves challenges like **model versioning**, **CI/CD for ML workflows**, and **production monitoring**—helping teams deploy, monitor, and improve ML models reliably.

---

## 💡 Background Story

Inspired by the complexity and manual effort of deploying machine learning models to production, this project was born out of the need for a seamless, automated, and production-grade ML workflow.  
My MLOps journey combines my backend development, DevOps, and AI engineering skills to deliver a practical, scalable MLOps solution.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion & Validation**: Seamlessly bring in and validate datasets for quality.
- **Scalable Model Training & Experiment Tracking**: Run reproducible experiments and track metrics.
- **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)**: Automate model builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Model Versioning & Registry**: Manage multiple model versions and metadata.
- **Automated Model Deployment**: Push models to production with minimal manual effort.
- **Model Monitoring & Alerting**: Detect performance degradation and data drift in real time.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python
- **ML Frameworks:** ZenML, MLflow
- **Data Orchestration & Experiment Tracking:** MLflow, DVC
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Other Tools:** DVC

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iam4syT/thinkbox.git
   cd mlops-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Typical pipeline commands:

- **Run data ingestion:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/data_ingestion.py
  ```

- **Train a model and log experiments:**
  ```bash
  mlflow run . -e train_model
  ```

- **Deploy the model via Docker:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t my_ml_model .
  docker run -p 8000:8000 my_ml_model
  ```

- **Access the prediction API:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [1, 2, 3]}'
  ```

## 📊 Example

A simple training pipeline with ZenML:

```python
from zenml.config import DockerSettings
from zenml.integrations.constants import MLFLOW
from zenml.pipelines import pipeline

docker_settings = DockerSettings(required_integrations=[MLFLOW])

@pipeline(enable_cache=False, settings={"docker": docker_settings})
def train_pipeline(ingest_data, clean_data, model_train, evaluation):
    """
    Args:
        ingest_data: DataClass
        clean_data: DataClass
        model_train: DataClass
        evaluation: DataClass
    Returns:
        mse: float
        rmse: float
    """
    df = ingest_data()
    x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = clean_data(df)
    model = model_train(x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test)
    mse, rmse = evaluation(model, x_test, y_test)
```
