# App Ideas – Proof of Concept Collection

This repository is a curated collection of **proof-of-concept prototypes** exploring different app ideas.  
Each project serves as a lightweight demonstration of an idea’s core functionality, built to test feasibility, design direction, or unique features before moving into full-scale development.
